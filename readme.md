# Background to the Portrait-Sitting Project

## What is a portrait-sitting?

A portrait-sitting is a moment of interaction between an artist, a sitter (the person who is portrayed) and sometimes others, from which a portrait is typically produced.

## What is the portrait-sitting database?

The Portrait-Sitting Database is a collection of information about portrait-sittings, specifically, sittings for British portraits 1900-1960 and, predominantly, portraits in the National Portrait Gallery. You can browse the database at www.portrait-sitting.co.uk

## What is the portrait-sitting ontology?

The Portrait-Sitting Ontology is a formal specification of the objects, concepts and relationships that make up knowledge about portrait-sittings. It is the framework, according to which the data in the Portrait-Sitting Database has been structured.

## Who is behind this project?

The portrait-sitting ontology and data are products of my (Dawn Kanter's) ongoing PhD research at The Open University, which is funded by the Open-Oxford-Cambridge AHRC DTP. The project is titled 'Collecting and Connecting Portrait-Sittings: A Re-evaluation of Portrait-Sitting Accounts in Enhancing Knowledge and Understanding of British Portraiture 1900-1960'.
